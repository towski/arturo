module Arturo

  # Adds whitelist and blacklist support to individual features by name
  # or for all features. Blacklists override whitelists. (In the world of
  # Apache, Features are "(deny,allow)".)
  # @example
  #   # allow admins for some_feature:
  #   Arturo::Feature.whitelist(:some_feature) do |user|
  #     user.is_admin?
  #   end
  #
  #   # disallow for small accounts for another_feature:
  #   Arturo::Feature.blacklist(:another_feature) do |user|
  #     user.account.small?
  #   end
  #
  #   # allow large accounts access to large features:
  #   Arturo::Feature.whitelist do |feature, user|
  #     feature.symbol.to_s =~ /^large/ && user.account.large?
  #   end
  #
  # Blacklists and whitelists can be defined before the feature exists
  # and are not persisted, so they are best defined in initializers.
  # This is particularly important if your application runs in several
  # different processes or on several servers.
